### This is my Github repo for my IT1050 summer 2021 college course ###
####
I have broken down my course work by lessons with all my C-sharp and screenshots in each folder.
I did this to not only keep things organized but also so that my professor could easily see my code.
We are using a web-based console to write and test the code, although it is good I have some difficulty with the file organization and how it works with github.
I have pasted the link to my replit below, hopefully this is not too confusing.
